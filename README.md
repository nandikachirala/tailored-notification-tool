This application allows users to send emails containing a subject and a body to specified segmented customer groups, allowing them to send targeted communication to customers. 

HTML and CSS were used to create the frontend, and Amazon Simple Email Service supports the backend, email-sending capabilities. Node was utilized to build this server-side application.

This Version 1 allows users to send emails with a subject and body to a generic customer segment, and a Version 2 of this project will allow users to connect those labels with a database, so they can populate customer segments with the appropriate email addresses.
